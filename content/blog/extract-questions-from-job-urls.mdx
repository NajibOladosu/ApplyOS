# Extract Questions from Any Job URL

One of the most time-consuming parts of applying for jobs and scholarships is identifying all the questions you need to answer. Application portals hide questions across multiple pages, and it's easy to miss something important.

**ApplyOS solves this with one-click question extraction.**

## How It Works

### Step 1: Paste the Job URL

Navigate to the Applications section in ApplyOS and click "Add Application." Simply paste the URL of any job posting, scholarship application, or opportunity.

```
https://example-company.com/careers/software-engineer
```

### Step 2: AI Extraction in Action

Our AI scans the entire page and identifies:

- **Required questions** (marked as mandatory)
- **Optional questions** (nice to have)
- **Essay prompts** (long-form responses)
- **Short answer fields** (brief responses)
- **Multiple choice selections** (when applicable)

### Step 3: Review and Organize

All extracted questions appear in a clean, organized interface. You can:

- Edit question text if needed
- Reorder questions by priority
- Mark questions as complete
- Generate AI answers with one click

## Supported Platforms

ApplyOS works with:

- **LinkedIn Jobs** - Direct extraction from job descriptions
- **Greenhouse** - Full support for their application forms
- **Lever** - Complete question extraction
- **Workday** - Handle complex multi-step applications
- **Custom portals** - Our AI adapts to any format

## Pro Tips for Best Results

### 1. Use the Original Application URL
For best results, paste the direct URL to the application page, not just the job description. This ensures we capture all questions.

### 2. Review Extracted Questions
Always review the extracted questions before generating answers. Sometimes portal-specific formatting may need minor adjustments.

### 3. Add Context
If the job posting mentions specific requirements or technologies, you can add this context to improve AI answer quality.

## What's Next?

Once questions are extracted, you're ready for the magic: **AI-powered answer generation**. ApplyOS analyzes your uploaded documents and generates personalized responses tailored to each question.
