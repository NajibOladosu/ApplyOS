# Tactical Briefing 001: The Context Engine

Generic AI is easy to spot. It uses words like "passionate," "delighted," and "robust" in ways that sound like a robot wrote a brochure. 

At **ApplyOS**, we don't just want you to apply faster; we want you to apply **better**. That is why we deployed the **Context Engine**.

### What is the Context Engine?

The Context Engine is a new layer in our generation protocol that allows you to provide "Directives" to the AI. Instead of just clicking "Generate," you are now the Director.

### 3 Ways to 10x Your Output

To get the most out of the system, use these three directive types when generating or regenerating your answers:

#### 1. The "Tone Shift"
If the default output feels too formal for a startup, or too casual for a law firm, tell the system.
> **Example Directive:** *"Rewrite this in a confident but concise tone. Avoid corporate jargon."*

#### 2. The "Experience Anchor"
Sometimes the AI misses a specific project in your resume that is perfect for a question. Force the system to focus on it.
> **Example Directive:** *"Focus heavily on my experience with React and the 15% performance increase I achieved at my last job."*

#### 3. The "Constraint Protocol"
When a text box has a character limit, don't waste time editing. Let the system handle the math.
> **Example Directive:** *"Keep the total response under 100 words while maintaining the mention of my leadership role."*

### The "Regenerate" Loop

The system is designed for iteration. If the first result is a 7/10, don't copy-paste it. Use the **Context Engine** to provide one small tweak and hit **Regenerate**. 

The goal is to reach a 10/10 answer in under 30 seconds.
