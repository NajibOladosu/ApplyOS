# Trackly is Now ApplyOS

Today marks an exciting milestone in our journey: **Trackly has officially evolved into ApplyOS**.

This isn't just a name change—it's a complete reimagining of what a job search tool can be.

## Why the Change?

When we started Trackly, our focus was simple: help people track their job applications. But as we built and listened to our users, we realized tracking was just one piece of a much larger puzzle.

Users weren't just asking for better tracking. They wanted:

- **Smarter document management** — A single place for resumes, transcripts, and certificates
- **Automated question extraction** — No more copying questions from applications manually  
- **AI-powered responses** — Personalized answers based on their actual experience
- **Interview preparation** — Practice before the real thing

Trackly was built to track. **ApplyOS is built to accelerate.**

## What's New in ApplyOS

### 1. Document Intelligence
Upload your documents once. Our AI extracts and organizes your experience, skills, and achievements into a structured profile that powers everything else.

### 2. One-Click Question Extraction
Paste any job URL and watch as ApplyOS identifies every question you need to answer—automatically.

### 3. AI Answer Generation
Get professional, personalized responses to application questions based on your documents. Review, edit, and perfect before submitting.

### 4. Interview Simulator
Practice with our AI interviewer before your real interview. Get feedback on your responses and build confidence.

### 5. Smart Pipeline Management
Track every application from discovery to offer. Never miss a deadline with smart notifications and priority management.

## What Happens to My Trackly Account?

**Good news: Nothing changes for you.** All your existing data, applications, and documents are preserved. You'll simply see the new ApplyOS branding when you log in.

## The Road Ahead

This is just the beginning. We're working on:

- **Browser extension** for even faster question extraction
- **LinkedIn integration** for seamless profile sync
- **Team features** for career coaches and counselors
- **Mobile app** for on-the-go application management

## Thank You

To everyone who's been with us since the Trackly days—thank you. Your feedback, suggestions, and support made ApplyOS possible.

And to everyone just discovering us: **welcome to the future of job searching.**
